                <h4 class="template4 palooma">What happens if I underestimate the size of the dumpster I need?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">If you find that the roll off dumpster you rented is too small, don't worry. Just give us a call, and we can arrange to pick up the full container and deliver a larger one. We'll work with you to ensure your project continues with minimal disruption.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Is it necessary to get a permit for my dumpster rental?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Permit requirements vary by municipality. If the roll off dumpster container can be placed entirely on your private property, like your driveway, a permit is usually not needed. However, if any part of the dumpster needs to be on a public street or sidewalk, you will likely need to obtain a permit from your local city or town hall.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">What is the difference between general debris and construction debris?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">General debris typically includes household items, furniture, and light yard waste. Construction debris refers to materials generated from building, remodeling, or demolition, such as wood, drywall, roofing, and concrete. Different disposal rates may apply, so it's important to let us know what you'll be throwing away.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">How do I schedule a pickup for my full dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">When your roll off rental in #State is full and your project is complete, simply give us a call to schedule the pickup. We ask that you provide us with at least 24 hours' notice to ensure we can accommodate your schedule.</p>
